# dropmap_nk_cell_analysis

This is a draft R code for analysis of perforin-deficient natural killer cell cytotoxicity profile with data generated using DropMap assay (Eyer, K. et al. 2017). This includes codes for: 1. splitting TIFF images into its component channels as while maintaining the image meta data, 2. migrating component channel images into folders with a name trace script, 3. analysing cell count data from a CellProfiler pipeline.
